# Game plan
This file lists the steps taken to create my minimal Linux distro, plans, requirements and all things that I wish to accomplish.
- [ ] Complete the LFS tutorial  
I need to complete the LFS tutorial first to make sure I understand how a Linux distribution is created.
- [ ] Complete the BLFS tutorial  
Similarly to above, BLFS is an extension to LFS and discusses more advances features of a Linux distro, this step will be taken at the same
time as further work is being done with designing the features I wish to include.
# Main features
The things listed below are features my distro cannot go without.
- [ ] as small as possible
- [ ] apt support
# Requirements
This is the section that goes into more detail about how each feature required is going to get accomplished.
### as small as possible
I want to make sure the footprint of the distro is as small as possible, while including several features I am familiar with from other distros
### apt support
apt has several dependencies, therefore I will need to build them and make sure they work correctly to use apt as my package manager of
choice
